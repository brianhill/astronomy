## The Cosmos: A Survey of Modern Astronomy

* Brian Hill [home page](../)

### Overview

The goal of the discipline of astronomy is to understand the great variety of astronomical observations in terms of the rather few principles of physics. Understanding astronomical observations from physics turns out to be a two-way street. Some of the principles of physics — for example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation — were deduced from astronomical observations in combination with laboratory physics experiments.

To do justice to the subject and to the scientific method, the class will use mathematics, but the mathematics will be limited to algebra and trigonometry. Every physics theory that we are confident of, we are confident of precisely because it has been tested quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Theories that are motivated principally by esthetic considerations, or that only give qualitative answers, have generally turned out to embarrassingly far off in the weeds.

The course will be primarily theoretical, but will also have a strong hands-on component. Students will do a significant special project from among the many that are possible with a 130mm refractor, a high-performance CMOS sensor, and research-grade software to control the equipment and analyze data. Possible projects include astrophotography of galaxies and nebulae, planetary imaging, spectroscopy, and variable star observation. Data-taking for the special project will occur during Term 5. Data analysis and presentation of results will occur during Term 6.

The theoretical part of the course will first focus on fundamentals such as the astronomical coordinate system, the motion of objects within our solar system, and the composition of Earth and the other planets. It will then proceed to our understanding of the nearby stars and the rest of our galaxy. At each step along the way we will emphasize not just what is known, but exactly how it has been determined. With these fundamentals, the student is properly and honestly prepared to move farther out into the cosmos, starting with what is known about galaxies in our galaxy cluster, then moving to the evidence for the Big Bang, and finally the complications of the properties of galaxies and the Big Bang that can only be explained by dark matter and dark energy.

### Materials

We will rely heavily on the latest edition of a textbook with a fully modern perspective. In a semester-long course with well-prepared students most of the textbook can be covered, and the unit outline that follows reflects that:
