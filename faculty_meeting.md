### Machiavelli

M Th 11-12:30

The Prince, Discourses, Plays, 20th c. political thinkers who have reflected on Machiavelli. Some Plato too.

## Justin

### Secularism and its Critics

M Th 11-12:30

Is secularism a fair, free, open? Going way back to fundamental texts that go back to understanding the role of religion in the modern polity and the ideas of what it is to be human. Augustine, Locke, Marx, and some 20th century thinkers who have things to say about anti-colonialism.

### Mathematical Analysis

M Th 11-12:30

The subject of real analysis was not sorted out until the mid-19th century when Weierstrass made rigorous sense of what Newton and Leibniz had called infinitesimals, and what we now know as limits and continuity. This allowed some outstanding problems (failures in Fourier analysis) to be solved, and became the way that all mathematicians learn the foundations of calculus. In this course the students are learning the fundamentals of real analysis and towards the end of the course they will also learn complex analysis.

### Astronomy

Tu Fr 11-12:30

We are conducting a complete survey of modern astronomy. This is relatively standard, except that we are being a little more mathematical in our derivations and a little more detailed about the scientific observations and their consequences than is usually done in introductory astronomy. We have a very current text (Pasachoff and Filippenko), and it is a treat for me to read the authors' accounts of the latest developments in the field.

BTW, I am grateful to the people that took some of the 8am slots. This semester I am sometimes out with the astronomy gear until 2am or even 3am, and I lobbied CurCom to have 11am classes so that I could get 7 hours of sleep and still have an hour or so before class to gather my thoughts.

## Margiana

### Politics, Agriculture and Food

Tu Fr 9:30

Much more  theoretical in Term 5. In Term 6, fictitious currently studying the fictitious commodities. of money, land, and labor. Racialized integration policy. Gender. World populism (population?) and climate change.

Pretty much every class a student is co-leading. The disinvitation question was really weighty. Several in-class discussions in the process of class.

Also an independent study with Milo and Ziani.

## Ana

### Aesthetics and Politics

M Th 8:00-9:30

A companion class to the course on political and social theory. Burke, Kant, Mark, Nietzhe all thought at about esthetics. It starts in the mid-18th century. Questions about liberalism, exchange-based society. In the mid-19th century, heavier on artists who write about politics. In the third part, Marx, Heidegger, Lodarno. Mass culture, technology. The class is informed by Anna's experience as a professional dancer. Incorporating some writing pedagogy in two workshops.

## Anna

### Smith and Marx

MTh 9:30-11:00

Straightforward in organization. Theory of Moral Sentiments and the Wealth of Nations. Fun! Students came in with a caricature of who Adam Smith was. Both texts undermine the caricature in exciting ways.

Now we are reading Marx, and they feel a bit deflated (because Marx is hard). Is Marx saying what I thought he said? What do all of these terms mean. Personal conflicts between students outside of class.

### WW I

Tu Fr 11:00-12:30

Aesthetic responses to the War. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Freud. A crisis of civilization. The war is symptomatic of the break. Right now we are reading The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. What does it mean to live in a world with such overwhelming technology that there isn't room for individual agency.

## Sarah

### Plato on Love

TuF 8am

Two Platonic dialogs on love and friendship. I find it enormously satisfying to read Plato here with these students, because the classes are small enough and the students are open-minded enough that instead of sticking to a particular school, we can widely explore the interpretations.
