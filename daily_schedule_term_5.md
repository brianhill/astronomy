Details will be added on an ongoing basis through the term.

### Week 1 &mdash; Chapters 1 and 2 &mdash; Units, Scientific Notation, Light, Temperature, Atoms, Atomic Spectra

* Tuesday, March 16 &mdash; Reading: Sections 1.1 to 1.4 (we'll be skipping 1.5 to 1.7) &mdash; Study Figure it Out Box 1.1 and Figure it Out Box 1.2 on units and scientific notation &mdash; In-Class Problems: Chapter 1, Problems 2, 8, and 24
* Friday, March 19 &mdash; Reading: Sections 2.1 to 2.4 including all four Figure it Out Boxes in Chapter 2 (that's all of Chapter 2 except the Doppler Shift which we will save and come back to when we need it) &mdash; In-Class Problems: Chapter 2, Problems 21, 22, and 24.

### Week 2 &mdash;Chapter 4 &mdash; The Daily, Monthly, and Annual Motions of the Heavens

* Tuesday, March 23 &mdash; The Cosmos: Section 4.1 (on the synodic and sidereal motion of Sun and Moon, moon phases) &mdash; The Friendly Stars: Chapters I and II &mdash; Venus in Transit: Chapter 3
* Friday, March 26 &mdash; The Cosmos: Sections 4.2 to 4.5, including Figure it Out Boxes 4.1 and Box 4.2 (eclipses, atmospheric effects of reddening and twinkling, daily motion of the stars, apparent magnitude)  &mdash; The Friendly Stars: Chapters III and IV (on Capella and Arcturus) &mdash; Venus in Transit: Chapters 1 and 2 (Copernicus and Kepler) &mdash; [2017 Eclipse Animation](https://youtu.be/yKFPL9xBe_U) &mdash; [2024 Eclipse Animation](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath2001/SE2024Apr08Tpath.html) &mdash; [The Ecliptic](https://youtu.be/eeQwYrfmvoQ) &mdash; Problem Set 1: Chapter 2, Problems 25, 26, 29, 30, Repeat problem 25 for 2.45 GHz microwave oven radiation. These are plug-in type problems except for 30, which forces you to rearrange the equation for *L* in Figure it Out Box 2.3 to solve for *T*, and then argue what must happen to *T* if *L* is doubled and nothing else changes.

### Week 3 &mdash; Chapter 4 &mdash; The Daily, Monthly, and Annual Motions of the Heavens

* Tuesday, March 30 &mdash; Finish Chapter 4 of The Cosmos. &mdash; Read Chapters XI, XII, XIII, and XIV from The Friendly Stars (the winter stars, which are now setting in the west) &mdash; Observe the stars in the west (compare with the star chart for the west that I handed out) and add your observing notes for those stars to the worksheet &mdash; Read Chapter 4 fromÂ Venus in Transit -- but not the appendix on parallax that I included along with Chapter 4.
* Friday, April 2

### Week 4 &mdash; Start Chapter 5 &mdash; Gravitation and Motion (through Kepler's Laws)

* Tuesday, April 6 &dash; Kepler's Laws (through Section 5.6)
* Friday, April 9 &mdash; First Midterm

### Week 5 &mdash; Finish Chapter 5 &mdash; Newton's Laws &mdash; Start Chapters 6 to 9 &mdash; The Rocky Planets

* Tuesday, April 13 &mdash; Newton's Laws
* Friday, April 16 &mdash; The Rocky Planets

### Week 6 &mdash; Finish Chapters 6 to 9 &mdash; the Gas Giants, The Asteroid Belt, The Kuiper Belt, and Other Planetary Systems (Exoplanets)

* Tuesday, April 20 &mdash; The Gas Giants, The Scale of the Solar System
* Friday, April 23 &mdash; The Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, Exoplanets

### Week 7 

* Tuesday, April 27 &mdash; Tuesday class canceled due to Shakespeare week
* Friday, April 30 &mdash; Friday class canceled due to break beginning Friday, April 30th


* ????Good problems for Problem Set 1: Chapter 2, Problems 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32????
