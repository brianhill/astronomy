## Astronomy First Day Feedback

Course [home page](./)

### Concerns and Hopes from Class

#### Concerns

* Textbook choice (at least three people had this concern). On the basis of the first reading, people found the text: too dry, too much of a survey ("science for English majors"), too lite.
* Math (too much emphasis, and/or dull math).
* Total class load (several students have three courses this term).
* Vocabulary and technical material might preclude seminar-style discussion.

#### Hopes

* Constellations (at least three people had this hope). Alice has seen some of my old star guides and suggested we incorporate them.
* Be an informed follower of new developments.
* Literature (especially, fiction or science fiction) and/or history.
* Wondrous (want to emphasize wonder).
* Vocabulary and technical material might give more.

### Concerns and Hopes from the Professor

* Concern: we have only about 26 meetings in Terms 5 and 6. Subtracting away time for three midterms, and presentation of the special project, it is hard to see how we can cover 20 chapters well. When I have taught the class before we had three meetings per week, which I think is easier for absorbing and pacing this kind of material.
* Hope: This is a new edition of Pasachoff and Filippenko that I haven't gotten to use. The Saint Mary's students were in general not making good use of the fourth edition. Prior to that I tried one other textbook which they also did not make great use of. The upshot is that this is my first chance to go through the 5th edition of the textbook with a group of strong students. That is something I was very much looking forward to, because astronomy is a wide and still rapidly advancing subject, and there is lots of it that I don't feel like I know the latest developments on.

### Ideas/Responses to Concerns and Hopes

* Critique Interstellar (the movie) that substantial input from Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne. What parts are scientifically realistic? What parts are unrealistic and impossible.
* Add a history book. One I have used is Miss Leavitt's Stars. It is a very nice account of the work done at Harvard to catalog variable stars. Henrietta Leavitt was a leader in the cataloguing. She and Edward Pickering (the head of the Harvard Observatory) discovered the Leavitt-Pickering Period-Luminosity Relationship. Leavitt died before Hubble used the relationship to build the early evidence for the Big Bang.
* I can figure out how to add constellations and star charts into the course. At Saint Mary's I had a double lab session on that (it used two of the two-hour lab blocks). In the first lab block, the students (in groups of 4) made complete star charts, each student doing about 1/4 of the sky. In the second lab block (which had to wait for a clear lab night), the students identified objects that they had charted.
